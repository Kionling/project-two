        <p style="font-weight: 800;">People will go through many journals through their lifetimes. Journals will constantly be lost, stolen, or damaged admist life itself.</p> <br>
        <p style="font-weight: 800;">The amount of information being lost within those endeavors and not to mention the amount of physical resources that go into developing a journal are costly.</p><br>
        <p style="font-weight: 800;">That's why HIKR was created. </p><br>
